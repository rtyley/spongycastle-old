The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
cryptographic algorithms, it was developed by the Legion of the
Bouncy Castle - with a little help! The Legion, and the latest
goings on with this package, can be found at
<a href=http://www.bouncycastle.org>http://www.bouncycastle.org</a>. 
<p>
The Legion also gratefully acknowledges the contributions made to this
package by others (see <a href=CONTRIBUTORS.html>here</a>
for the current list).
<p>
The package is organised so that it 
contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
(including the newly released J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
<p>
This software is distributed under a license based on the MIT X
Consortium license.  To view the license, <a href="./LICENSE.html">
see here</a>
<p>
To view examples, look at the test programs in the packages:
<ul>
    <li><b>org.bouncycastle.crypto.test</b>
    <li><b>org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test</b>
</ul>
<p>
To verify the packages, run the following Java programs with the
appropriate classpath:
<ul>
    <li><b>java org.bouncycastle.crypto.test.RegressionTest</b>
    <li><b>java org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test.RegressionTest</b>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note 1:</b>The JCE classes are only distributed with the JDK 1.1, JDK 1.2, and JDK 1.3 JCE releases. The
JDK 1.0, J2ME, and the JDK 1.1, JDK 1.2 and JDK 1.3 lightweight releases only include the
Bouncy Castle lightweight cryptography API.
<b>Note 2:</b>The regression test for Diffie-Hellman is quite slow.
