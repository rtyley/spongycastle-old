<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of 
cryptographic algorithms.  The package is organised so that it 
contains a light-weight API suitable for use in any environment
(including the newly released J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
<p>

<h3>2.2.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.34
<h3>2.2.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Endianess of integer conversion in KDF2BytesGenerator was incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>Generating critical signature subpackets in OpenPGP would result in a zero packet tag. This has been fixed.
<li>Some flags in PKIFailure info were incorrect, and the range of values was incomplete. The range of values has been increased and the flags corrected.
<li>The helper class for AuthorityKeyExtension generation was including the subject rather than the issuer DN of the CA certificate. This has been fixed.
<li>SMIMESignedParser now avoids JavaMail quoted-printable recoding issue.
<li>Verification of RSA signatures done with keys with public exponents of 3 was vunerable to
Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery attack. This has been fixed.
<li>PGP Identity strings were only being interpreted as ASCII rather than UTF8. This has been fixed.
<li>CertificateFactory.generateCRLs now returns a Collection rather than null.
</ul>
<h3>2.2.3 Additional Features and Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>An ISO18033KDFParameters class had been added to support ISO18033 KDF generators.
<li>An implemention of the KDF1 bytes generator algorithm has been added.
<li>An implementation of NaccacheStern encryption has been added to the lightweight API.
<li>X509V2CRLGenerator can now be loaded from an existing CRL.
<li>The CMS enveloped data generators will now attempt to use the default provider for encryption if the passed in provider can only handle key exchange.
<li>OpenPGP file processing has been substantially speeded up.
<li>The PKCS1Encoder would accept PKCS1 packets which were one byte oversize. By default this will now cause an error. However, as there are still implementations which still produce such packets the older behaviour can be turned on by setting the VM system property org.bouncycastle.pkcs1.strict to false before creating an RSA cipher using PKCS1 encoding.
<li>A target has been added to the bc-build.xml to zip up the source code rather than leaving it in a directory tree.
The build scripts now run this target by default.
<li>Use of toUpperCase and toLowerCase has been replaced with a locale independent converter where appropriate.
<li>Support for retrieving the issuers of indirect CRLs has been added.
<li>Classes for doing incremental path validation of PKIX cert paths have been added to the X.509 package and S/MIME.

<li>Performance of the prime number generation in the BigInteger library has been further improved.
</ul>
<h3>2.2.5 Security Advisory</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are using public exponents with the value three you *must* upgrade to this release, otherwise it
will be possible for attackers to exploit some of Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery attacks on your applications.
</ul>
<h3>2.3.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.33
<h3>2.3.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>OCSPResponseData was including the default version in its encoding. This has been fixed.

<li>The n value for prime192v2 was incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>ArmoredInputStream was not closing the underlying stream on close. This has been fixed.
<li>Small base64 encoded strings with embedded white space could decode incorrectly using the Base64 class. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<li>X9FieldElement could fail to encode a Fp field element correctly. This has been fixed.
<li>The streaming S/MIME API was occasionally leaving temporary files around. The SIMEUtil class responsible for creating the files now returns a FileBackedMimeBodyPart object
which has a dispose method on it which should allow removal of the file backing the body part.
<li>An encoding defect in EnvelopedData generation in the CMS streaming, S/MIME API has been fixed.
<li>DER constructed octet strings could cause exceptions in the streaming ASN.1 library. This has been fixed.
<li>Several compatibility issues connected with EnvelopedData decoding between the streaming CMS library and other libraries have been fixed.

</ul> 
<h3>2.8.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.28
<h3>2.8.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Signatures on binary encoded S/MIME messages could fail to validate when correct. This has been fixed.

<h3>2.8.4 Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Patches for S/MIME binary signatures and canonicalization were actually applied in 1.27, but a couple of days after the release - if the class 
CMSProcessableBodyPartOutbound is present in the package org.bouncycastle.mail.smime you have the patched 1.27. We would recommend upgrading to 1.28 in any case
as some S/MIME 3.1 recommendations have also been introduced for header creation.

with a JCE interface with the same method signature. The getParams() method in pre-1.5 has been deprecated.
<li>SHA256WithRSAEncryption, SHA384WithRSAEncryption, SHA512WithRSAEncryption now refer to their PKCS #1 V1.5 implementations. If you
were using these previously you should use SHA256WithRSAAndMGF1, SHA384WithRSAAndMGF1, or SHA512WithRSAAndMGF1.
</ul>
<h3>2.10.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.26

<li>X509Name now recognises international characters in the input string and
stores them as BMP strings.
<li>Parsing a message with a zero length body with SMIMESigned would cause an exception. This has been fixed.
<li>Some versions of PGP use zeros in the data stream rather than a replication of the last two bytes of the iv as specified in the RFC to determine if the correct decryption key has been found. The decryption classes will now cope with both.
</ul>

the provider wasn't padding the return value of the key usage extension to
8 booleans in length. This has been fixed.
<li>In some cases the simple BC keystore allowed overwriting of an alias with
one of the same name. This has been fixed.

This has been fixed.
<li>PKCS7 SignedData now supports single length signing chains.
<li>When a root certificate had a different issuer id from the subject id, or
had it's own AuthorityKeyExtension the PKCS12 key store would drop the root
certificate from the certificate chain. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS10 CertificationRequestInfo class always expected at least one
attribute. This has been fixed.
<li>UTF8 strings are now correctly recognised.
<li>The Tiger implementation was producing results in reverse byte
order for each of the 3 words making up the digest. This has been fixed.

</ul>

<h3>2.23.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The key to keySpec handling of the secret key factories has been improved.
    <li>There is now a SMIME implementation and a more complete CMS
        implementation (see CONTRIBUTORS file for additonal details).

    being contributed. A work around to allow it to be used with jdk1.2 and
    jdk1.3 has also been added. Note: the implementation is not quite complete
    because policymapping, name and subtree contraints are not yet
    implemented.
    <li>The API now supports the generation of PKCS7 signed objects. Note: this
    is still beta code - one known issue is that it doesn't support single

</ul>

<h3>2.24.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.12
<h3>2.24.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The ASN.1 library was unable to read an empty set object. This has been fixed.
    <li>Returning sets of critical and non-critical extensions on X.509 certificates could result in a null pointer exception if the certificate had no extensions. This has been fixed.
    <li>The BC JKS implementation does not follow the conventional one - it has been renamed BKS, an attempt to create a JKS keystore using the BC provider will now result in an exception.
    <li>The PKCS 10 generator verify(provider) method was ignoring the provider when generating the public key. This has been fixed.
    <li>The PKCS12 store would throw an OutOfMemoryException if passed a non-PKCS12 file. This has been fixed.
    <li>In the case where there was no AuthorityKeyIdentifier the PKCS12 store
    would fail to find certificates further up the signing chain. The store now
    uses the IssuerDN if no AuthorityKeyIdentifier is specified and the IssuerDN
    is different from the SubjectDN,
    <li>PKCS10/CertificationRequestInfo objects with only a single attribute wer
    not being handled properly. This has been fixed.
    <li>getExtensionValue for X.509 CRLs was returning the value of the
    DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This
    has been fixed.
    <li>the IV algorithm parameters class would improperly throw an exception
    on initialisation. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.25.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>X9.23 padding of MACs now works correctly with block size aligned data.
<li>Loading a corrupted "UBER" key store would occassionally cause the
appearance of hanging. This has been fixed.
<li>Loading a PKCS12 store where not all certificates had PKCS9 attributes
assigned to them would cause a NullPointerException. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 store wasn't correctly recovering certificate chains of
length less than 2 on calling the getCertificateChain method. This has been
fixed.
<li>Lone certificates were not been stored in the PKCS12 store. This has been fixed.
<li>CFB and OFB modes weren't padding iv's more than 1 byte less than the 
block size of the cipher if the mode was reused with a shorter IV. This has
been fixed.
<li>IV handling and block size return values for CFB and OFB modes wasn't being handled in the same way as the Sun reference implementation. This has been fixed.
<li>CertificateInfoRequests were not handling null attributes correctly. This
has been fixed.
<li>Tags for the X.509 GeneralName structure were wrongly encoded. This has been
fixed.
<li>getExtensionValue for X.509 certificates was returning the value of the
DER-Encoded octet string not the DER-Encoded octet string as required. This has
been fixed.
<li>reset on the version 3 X.509 certificate generator was not flushing the
extensions. This has been fixed.
<li>The NetscapeCert type bits were reversed! This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.25.3 Additional Functionality and Features</h3>

<li>EC Public/Private keys are now encoded in accordance with SEC 1. The library
will still read older keys as well.
<li>Added PKCS12-DEF a pkcs12 based key store which works around a bug in
the Sun keytool - it always uses the default provider for creating certificates.
<li>A cut down version of the Rijndael has been added that provides the functionality required to conform the the AES. It is designed to fully support FIPS-197. A fips AES wrapper (AESWrap in the JCE, AESWrapEngine in the lightweight library has also been added).
<li>Elliptic curve routines now handle uncompressed points as well as the
compressed ones.
</ul>
<h3>2.25.4 Other changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>As the range of public key types supported has expanded the getPublicKey
method on the SubjectPublicKeyInfo class is not always going to work. The

</ul>
<h3>2.26.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.10
<h3>2.26.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The PKCS12 Key Store now interoperates with the JDK key tool. <b>Note:</b> this does mean the the key name passed to the setKeyEntry calls has become

</ul>
<h3>2.27.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.09

at the upper level of the JCE, rather than falling over in the lightweight
library.
<li>ISO10126Padding now incorporates the correct amount of random data.
<li>The PKCS12 key store wasn't picking up certificate chains properly
when being used to write PKCS12 files. This has been fixed.
<li>The Twofish engine would call System.exit if the key was too large.
This has been fixed.

<li>Support for RC5-64 has been added to the JCE.
<li>ISO9796-2 signatures have been added to the JCE and lightweight API.
<li>A more general paddings packge for use with MACs and block ciphers had been aded to the lightweight API. MACs now allow you to specify padding.

PaddedBlockCipher class is now deprecated see org.bouncycastle.crypto.paddings for details.
<li>SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are now added. Note: while the public review
period has finished, these algorithms have not yet been standardised, in the
event that final standardisation changes the algorithms these implementations
will be changed.
<li>It's now possible to set bag attributes on items to go into a PKCS12 store,
using the org.bouncycastle.jce.interfaces.PKCS12BagAttributeCarrier interface.
<li>More classses have been added to the ASN.1 package for dealing with
certificate extensions and CRLs including a CRL generator. Note: the
CRL generators should be regarded as under development and subject to change.
<li>There's now an examples package for the JCE (in addition to the examples
in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.test) - org.bouncycastle.jce.examples. It
currently consists of a class showing how to generate a PKCS12 file.
<li>The X.509 CertificateFactory now includes CRL support.  DER or PEM CRLs may be processed.
<li>The BigInteger library has been written with a view to making it less
resource hungry and faster - whether it's fast enough remains to be seen!
</ul>

<h3>2.28.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.08

<h3>2.28.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It wasn't possible to specify an ordering for distinguished names in
X509 certificates. This is now supported.
<li>In some circumstances stream Ciphers in the JCE would cause null pointer
exceptions on doFinal. This has been fixed.
<li>Unpadded ciphers would sometimes buffer the last block of input, even
if it could be processed. This has been fixed.

including a keystore for the JCA.
<li>The message digests MD4, Tiger, and RIPEMD128 have been added to the
JCE and the lightweight API. Note: MD4 and RIPEMD128 have been added for
compatibility purposes only - we recommend you don't use them for anything new!
<li>The JDK 1.1 certificate classes didn't conform to the JDK 1.2 API as
the collections class was not present. Thanks to a donated collections API
this is fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.29.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.07

<h3>2.29.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>It turned out that the setOddParity method in the DESParameter class
was indeed doing something odd but not what was intended. This is now
fixed. <b>Note:</b>This will affect some PBE encryptions that were carried
out with DES, equivalent PBE ciphers to the old PBE DES cipher can be
accessed by prepending the work "Broken" in front of the original PBE cipher
call. If you want an example of how to deal with this as a migration issue
have a look in org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.JDKKeyStore lines 201-291.
</ul>
<h3>2.30.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.06

<h3>2.30.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman keys are now properly serialisable as well as
encodable.
<li>Three of the semi-weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, were incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>DESEDE key generators now accept 112 and 168 as the key sizes, as well
as 128 and 192 (for those people who don't like to count the parity bits).
<li>Providing no strength parameter is passed to the DESede key generator in
the JCE provider, the provider now generates DESede keys in the k1-k2-k1
format (which is compatible with the Sun reference implementation), otherwise
you get what you ask for (3-DES or 2-DES in the minimum number of bytes).
<li>Base Diffie-Hellman key agreement now works correctly for more than two
parties.
<li>Cipher.getAlgorithmParameters was returing null in cases where a cipher
object had generated it's own IV. This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the key store occasionally caused checks of entry types to
result in a null pointer exception. This has been fixed.
<li>RSA key generator in JCE now recognises RSAKeyGenerationParameterSpec.
<li>Resetting and resusing HMacs in the lightweight and heavyweight libraries
caused a NullPointer exception. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The DESEDE key generator can now be used to generate 2-Key-DESEDE
keys as well as 3-Key-DESEDE keys.
<li>One of the weak keys in the DESParameters, and the DESKeySpec look
up table, was incorrect. This has been fixed.
<li>The PKCS12 generator was only generating the first 128-160 bits of the
key correctly (depending on the digest used). This has been fixed.
<li>The ASN.1 library was skipping explicitly tagged objects of zero length.
This has been fixed.
</ul>
<h3>2.31.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is now an org.bouncycastle.jce.netscape package which has
a class in for dealing with Netscape Certificate Request objects.
</ul>
<h3>2.31.4 Additional Notes</h3>
<p>
Concerning the PKCS12 fix: in a few cases this may cause some backward
compatability issues - if this happens to you, drop us a line at
<a href="mailto:feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org">feedback-crypto@bouncycastle.org</a>
and we will help you get it sorted out.

<h3>2.32.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.04

<h3>2.32.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Signatures generated by other providers that include optional null
parameters in the AlgorithmIdentifier are now handled correctly by the
provider.
<li>The JCE 1.2.1 states that the names of algorithms associated with the JCE
are case insensitive. The class that matches algorithms to names now tries
to match the name given with it's equivalent in upper case, before trying
to match it as given. If you write a provider and include versions of your
algorithm names in uppercase only, this JCE implementation will always
match a getInstance regardless of the case of the algorithm passed into
the getInstance method.
<li>If the JCE API and the Provider were in a different class path, the
class loader being used sometimes failed to find classes for JCE Ciphers, etc.
This has been fixed.
<li>An error in the ASN.1 library was causing problems serialising Diffie-Hellman keys. This has been fixed.
<li>The agreement package was left out of the j2me bat file. This has been fixed.
<li>The BigInteger class for 1.0 and the j2me wasn't able to generate random
integers (prime or otherwise). This has been fixed. 
<li>The BigInteger class would sometimes go into a death spiral if the any
32nd bit of an exponent was set when modPow was called. This has been fixed. 
<li>Cipher.getInstance would treat "//" in a transformation as a single "/".
This has been fixed.
<li>PBEWithSHAAndIDEA-CBC was throwing an exception on initialisation. This has
been fixed.
<li>The X509Name class in the asn1.x509 package wasn't initialising its local
hash table when the hash table constructor was called. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.32.3 Additional Functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Elliptic Curve DSA (X9.62) - ECDSA - to provider and lightweight
library.
<li>Added Elliptic Curve basic Diffie-Hellman to provider and lightweight
library.

<h3>2.33.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.03

<h3>2.33.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>CFB and OFB modes when specified without padding would insist on input
being block aligned. When specified without padding CFB and OFB now behave in a compatible 
fashion (a doFinal on a partial block will yield just the data that could
be processed).
In short, it provides another way of generating cipher text the same
length as the plain text.
</ul>

<h3>2.34.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.02

<h3>2.34.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RSA key pair generator occasionally produced keys 1 bit under the
requested size. This is now fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.35.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.01

<h3>2.35.2 Defects Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Buffered ciphers in lightweight library were not resetting correctly
on a doFinal. This has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.36.1 Version</h3>
Release 1.0 

<h3>2.36.2 Defects Fixed</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>JDK1.2 version now works with keytool for certificate generation.
<li>Certificate toString method no longer throws a null pointer exception
if a group [3] extension has not been added.
<li>Under some circumstances the NullCipher would throw a NullPointerException,
this has been fixed.
<li>Under some circumstances CipherInputStream would throw a NullPointerException, this has been fixed.
<li>OpenSSL/SSLeay private key encodings would cause an exception to be thrown
by the RSA key factory. This is now fixed.
<li>The Cipher class always used the default provider even when one was specified, this has been fixed.
</ul>

<h3>2.35.3 Additional functionality</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Argument validation is much improved.
<li>An X509KeyUsage class has been added to the JCE class to make it easier
to specify the KeyUsage extension on X.509 certificates.
<li>The library now allows creation of version 1 certificates as well.
</ul>

<h3>3.0 Notes</h3>
<p>
The J2ME is only supported under Windows.
<p>
If you are trying to use the lightweight provider in a JDK 1.0 applet, you
need to change the package names for java.math.BigInteger, java.lang.IllegalStateException, and java.security.SecureRandom
<p>
The RSA test under JDK 1.0 and J2ME takes a while to run...
